The scope of the project you will be working on is:  Eastman Business Park is one of the largest industrial parks in the world encompassing 1,200 acres.  That‰Ûªs 50% bigger than New York City‰Ûªs Central Park.  In terms of building space, the Park is home to 16 million square feet of manufacturing, distribution, office, laboratory, clean room, recreational and conference space.  That‰Ûªs 2.5 times more space under roof than the Pentagon. Ninety-five companies call Eastman Business Park home today.  That‰Ûªs up from 85 a year ago, and our goal is to attract ten more in 2017.  Over 6,000 people work in the Park and over $4 billion in manufacturing revenue is generated by companies like Kodak, Carestream, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Harris, LiDestri Food and Drink, Kodak Alaris and Columbia Care.   As big as we are, we have a lot of room to grow.  From our 2,000 seat theater where we will have a new venue manager, a new marquee and renovations to the lobby to the new energy storage center where eight companies are building batteries that will help reduce our dependence on fossil fuels we are in growth mode.   We are adding new tenants and expanding the footprints of existing tenants.  One of the most important things any employer looks for when choosing a location for a manufacturing operation is talent.  They want to know that as soon as they set up shop, they will be able to hire top quality talent at a competitive wage.  And beyond that, they want to know that as they grow they will be able to obtain the skills they need.  This means we need to work with local schools and colleges, companies and business associations to build a pipeline of talent.  One of the ways Eastman Business Park supports this is by hosting the annual MFG DAY event.  In 2016 over 400 high school students attended a half day program at the Park to learn about TODAY‰Ûªs manufacturing careers.  We had a presentation with high impact video, a panel of recent graduates who are embarking on a manufacturing career, a panel of managers from employers and an interview with a very successful business man who now owns his own manufacturing company.  The event also had exhibitors from 10 different organizations, including employers, educators and associations. We plan to do it again in 2017 and need a skilled organizer and marketer to develop the plans, coordinate among the entities, and make sure the event comes off smoothly.  That‰Ûªs why, for this role, we would like to hire an intern with sales, marketing and organizational skills.   Management of this single, large project will give the candidate a great experience and great resume material.

In a world‰Û_ where science fiction is constantly making promises that actual science can‰Ûªt deliver. Where phone booths don‰Ûªt teleport themselves, and zero calorie beer has yet to exist. One company had the courage to stand up and say, ‰ÛÏHey! Science! Where‰Ûªs my jetpack?‰Û Hi. We‰Ûªre Anki. When our Co-Founders Boris, Mark and Hanns met in the Ph.D program at Carnegie Mellon‰Ûªs Robotics Institute, they didn‰Ûªt dream about artificial intelligence that sends you speeding tickets in the mail, or shrink wraps shrink-wrap. They were united by a shared habit of saying ‰ÛÏHey, wouldn‰Ûªt it be cool if...?‰Û then actually making that cool thing happen.  Now, we know what you‰Ûªre thinking: we‰Ûªre just another all black-wearing, white cat-stroking bunch of weirdos designing laser-powered panini machines in an underground lair somewhere. Nope. Anki is made up of non-crazy people building crazy-cool AI and robotics that are reinventing physical entertainment. Sound crazy? Maybe. But crazy-in-a-good-way. Maybe that‰Ûªs why Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced our first product, Anki Drive, in his keynote at WWDC in June 2013. And why top-tier VC‰Ûªs including Andreessen Horowitz, Index Ventures, and Two Sigma trust us with their money. Anki is taking years of fancy research and incomprehensible 1‰Ûªs and 0‰Ûªs and turning them into exciting things that people actually want. Things they want real bad. Things they didn‰Ûªt even think could exist. Imagine impossible interactive experiences. Imagine video games in real life. Imagine jetpacks. And we‰Ûªre just getting started.  Excited? Us too.
